	I am an avid horror movie fan and have had the opportunity to work on several
	 independent projects in the Phoenix area.&nbsp; The first film I worked was 
	"Night of the Chihuahuas" in 2003.&nbsp; Intended to be the film that put 
	Arizona on the map, this film was made for 5000$, and it shows!&nbsp; Billed 
	as "the absolute worst 'movie' I have seen in my entire life" by IMDB user 
	gremlin-20, NOTC was debuted at the recently defunct Hollywood Alley 
	alongside another local film that was (thankfully) much worse than ours.&nbsp;

	 <p> 
	 Drunk rating: 10 drinks to watch this movie
	 </p>

	 <p>The second film I worked on was titled "The Lonely Ones". After 
	 securing a modest budget for this rather ambitious project, principle photography began 
	 in July 2004 in Greer, AZ.&nbsp; We quickly learned the disadvantages of 
	 trying to film a horror film at night in Arizona summer.&nbsp; Not to be 
	 deterred, the cast and crew sullied forth to create a movie that was 
	 actually kind of watchable.</p>
